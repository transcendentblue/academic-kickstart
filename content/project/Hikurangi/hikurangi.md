The thermal structure of accretionary prisms provides important constraints on the tectonics and rheology of the wedge, a constraint on metamorphism of the rocks in that subduction zones, and on the amount, rates and pathways of fluid flow through modeling of heat advection (i.e. transport of heat due to bulk movement of fluids). Heat flow anomalies associated with fluid flow are commonly observed in accretionary prisms, examples include the Barbados, Northern Cascadia and Makran accretionary prisms e.g. (Davis et al., 1990). Foucher et al. analyzed heat flow patterns at two locations near the toe of the Barbados Ridge accretionary prism. They found that the relative highs of heat flow were associated with zones of thrust faulting and concluded that these highs were caused by upward transport of hot water along these faults. Davis et al. made 110 heat flow determinations along the northern Cascadia accretionary prism including data derived from violin-bow probe measurements and BSRs. They found the values derived from heat probe measurements to be 35% higher than BSR heat flow estimates over the lower slope of the prism, and attributed this discrepancy to vertical advection of pore fluids through the sediments at a rate of approximately 8e-10 m/s. This value is consistent with the fluid expulsion rate calculated from porosity decrease which further demonstrates the efficacy of thermal modeling in constraining fluid transport.  

Preliminary analyzes of heat flow data obtained across the northern Hikurangi margin, New Zealand, indicates an average background heat flow of 56 mW/m2 for the subduction margin (figure 1a). However, short wavelength variations from this mean are observed within 15 km of the deformation front (landward), which could be explained by the existence discharge of warm fluids through one or more of the several splay faults that intersect the seafloor in the area. The modeling of this heat flow data presents thus an opportunity to gain further insight into the accretionary prism's heat and fluid flow regime, distribution of fluid pressures, as well as the hydrologic and mechanical properties of its sediments and faults. In addition, the interplay between these processes and properties is thought to exert a first order control in the location and timing of earthquake occurrence in the region (Ellis, 2015). With this approach in mind, I've been developing a two-dimensional numerical model of coupled fluid flow and heat transport to test the hypothesis that fluid discharge through one of the splay faults at the Hikurangi accretionary prism can be used to explain the heat flow observations across it.
