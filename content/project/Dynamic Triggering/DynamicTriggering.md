Large earthquakes have been previously shown to induce smaller earthquakes at remote locations (Johnson and Jia, 2005}. Many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the dynamic triggering of earthquakes - these mechanisms are usually based upon the notion that pore fluid pressure increase inside the fault gouge material is the primary cause for failure of the fault rock e.g.(Gomberg et al., 1998; Brodsky et al., 2000). However, there is very little experimental or field validation of these fluid-rock interaction models for earthquake triggering and in the few cases where they seem to be applicable, the proposed models suffer from over-parametrization making them inapplicable to other similar cases e.g. (Miller et al., 2004}. One implication is that there other mechanisms that could explain dynamically induced fault slip.

Previous studies have argued that earthquake triggering is a function of dynamic elastic nonlinearities of fault gauge, i.e. there is a decrease in the strength of fault gauge material when it is under the influence of seismic strains (Johnson et al., 2000). In other words, in this mechanism for dynamic earthquake triggering, a decrease in the bulk modulus of fault gouge (instead of the effective stress) after it is perturbed by a remote earthquake, is the main cause behind the eventual slip of said fault. To test this hypothesis, Johnson and Jia (2005) conducted laboratory resonance experiments on a granular sample made off glass beads to simulate the mechanics of fault gouge after it is perturbed by seismic waves. They found that the modulus of the sample decreased temporarily after it was disturbed (softening) and provided the first evidence that this weakening is one of the more likely mechanisms for dynamic earthquake triggering (figure 1). Other workers have since published both laboratory and field observations of reduced seismic velocities after the occurrence of large earthquakes. For example, Rubinstein and Beroza (2006) measured the relative arrival times for two microearthquake sequences events happening after the 2004 Parkfield earthquake and they found widespread velocity reductions related to the earthquake. 

Despite many observations of such nonlinear softening of fault gauge, most of the current models proposed to explain such behavior have failed to elucidate the nature of the physical processes behind it. This problem was further exacerbated by the previous lack of experimental methods that could properly account for and constrain the nonlinear elastic behavior of the samples. Standard methods for measuring the elastic parameters of granular material only yield average bulk variations of these parameters and don't provide quantitative information related to more complex elastic nonlinear signatures, such as, hysteresis and conditioning. In contrast, Dynamic acoustoelasticity testing (DAET) is an experimental method that allows quantification of local, nonlinear elastic behavior in a diverse range of materials (Riviere, 2013). In this method, the speed of sound through the sample is measured with high-frequency pulses sent across it while at the same time,  a low frequency wave source is used to stress the sample allowing it to be tested under both compression and tension (figure 2). This allows us to obtain the elastic response of the material over a complete dynamic stress cycle. For this study, I propose to explore the changes in material properties of fault gouge through a series of controlled DAET experiments. More specifically, I propose to explore the frequency and pressure dependence of acoustic waves traveling through unconsolidated fault gouge in order to get a better understanding of its elastic properties.
